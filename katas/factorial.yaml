title: Calculate Factorial
description: |
  Write a function `factorial(n)` that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
  
  The factorial of n (written as n!) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
  By definition, 0! = 1.
  
  Examples:
  - 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
  - 3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6
  - 0! = 1
