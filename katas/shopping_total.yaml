title: How Much Will You Spend?
description: |
  Given a dictionary of items and their costs and an array specifying the items
  bought, calculate the total cost of the items plus a given tax.

  If item doesn't exist in the given cost values, the item is ignored.

  Output should be rounded to two decimal places.

  Python:

  ```python
  costs = {'socks':5, 'shoes':60, 'sweater':30}
  get_total(costs, ['socks', 'shoes'], 0.09)
  #-> 5+60 = 65
  #-> 65 + 0.09 of 65 = 70.85
  #-> Output: 70.85
  ```
