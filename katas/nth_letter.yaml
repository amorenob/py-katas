title: Nth Letter Concatenation
description: |
  Complete the function that takes an array of words.

  You must concatenate the n th letter from each word to construct a new word which should be returned as a string, where n is the position of the word in the list.

  For example:

  ["yoda", "best", "has"] --> "yes"
  ^       ^       ^
  n=0     n=1     n=2

  Note: Test cases contain valid input only - i.e. a string array or an empty array; and each word will have enough letters.
